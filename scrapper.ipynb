    "## Article Title: An Academic Exploration of Data Scraping for Job Application Automation\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In today's competitive job market, efficiency is key. Automating repetitive tasks is one way to improve this efficiency. While full automation might not be possible due to varying application requirements and human interactions, partial automation can certainly help ease the burden. This article explores the technical aspects of automating job applications, focusing on the theoretical concept rather than practical application to ensure we abide by websites' terms of service.\n",

    "### What is Web Scraping?\n",
    "Web scraping is a technique for extracting information from websites. It automates the manual process of collecting data from the web, using various programming languages and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in any web scraping project is to import the necessary Python packages and set up a web driver. The web driver allows us to programmatically control a web browser, enabling interactions with web pages just as a human user would.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this academic example, we'll be using Selenium, a powerful tool for controlling a web browser through programs and automating browser automation. We'll also use pandas for data manipulation and time for pause delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we do it:"
